# Mini Project : Discount Calculator 

In this mini project we are creating a Discount Calculator for a mall to help calculate Bill after applying Discount. 


Here we are taking information from user for purchase item. Simply do the total and apply bill according to our Discount offers!!!

* For purchase below 1000 : 10 % Discount
* For purchase between 1000 and 2000 : 20 % Discount
* For purchase above 2000 : 30 % Discount

Tips: 
1. Create index.html and bill.html and put them in templates folder. Make sure that this templates folder is in same directory as our main app.py file.
